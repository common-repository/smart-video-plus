== Description ==


VideoSwiper SmartVideoPlus 4.0 adds features designed to make WordPress 
the ideal platform for hosting a video site, it will automatically turn
your normal WP blog into a full & powerful video CMS allowing you to embed
videos from any video website that allows embedding without having to use
embed tokens, it comes complete with an admin panel to add videos that will
display on your blog like a video website, it also uses JS & ajax to display
the video content on your blogs.

SmartVideoPlus is free to download and use and has no requirements to be plugged
into the online application VideoSwiper.com unless you want to so you can mass embed
at faster rates to add thousands at a time and not single embeds at a time.

SmartVideoPlus is fully intergrated into the VideoSwiper online application
so you do not need to add videos one by one, by plugging your WP site into
VideoSwiper you will be able to mass embed videos from over 30 top video sharing
sites 100's per second, the intergration of VideoSwiper will also display the media
in the same way your blog does it when manually adding videos.

Good News Guys, SmartVideoPlus is (SMART) there is no list of supported video sites
as smartvideoplus supports absolutely every video website online that offers embed code.

There is simply no limitations to what video you add through this plugin

run your (smartvideoplus) plugin, this version works only with the theme supplied, this version extends
the plugin even further with flash videos been viewed, latest videos in footer, random video player on
the homepage, tabbed ajax latest, most popular and top rated video boxes, and related videos under players.


***End of Theme Installation***


Stand Alone Installation Using Your Own Themes.

This version is for use of the (SmartVideoPlus) plugin which can be used on most WordPress themes that use the wp_header
token in the header.php file of your theme. The stand alone version will display video in an ordered fashion again using
thumbnails to display video and not players, again ajax popups for on page players and video post pages will have related
videos under the players but the rest of the functions are only found when using the theme dependant version.


1. Extract the files from the zip (smartvideoplus). open the folder then Copy the /plugins/videoswiper/ directory into
   /wp-content/plugins/ folder.

2. Goto your WordPress admin panel & activate the videoswiper plugin supplied in the zip 
   through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. You will now see that in wp-admin under dashboard>>posts there is a new menu item called (submit video)
   once you click on this menu item you will be able to manually add videos from any video website online without
   requiring any [tokens] for embedding, this plugin is pure copy and paste making it really easy and fast to
   add videos from just about anywhere, all videos added this way will display using the SVP plugin CSS layout.
